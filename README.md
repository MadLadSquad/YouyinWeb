## About Youyin
Youyin(卣囙/yǒuyīn) is a simple platform for practicing hanzi/kanji/hanja/汉字/漢字 and/or other writing systems

We use a simple flashcard based approach to learning to read, write and understand 汉字. There are 3 components of the app:
1. Introduction to 汉字 to help beginners with learning the fundamentals
1. 汉字 discover that gives you some new and exciting 汉字 to learn
1. 汉字 practice - Helps you learn to read and write the given character

The app is not a dictionary, the user is supposed to use a separate dictionary(like [pleco](https://pleco.com) for Chinese)

The app also supports limited features for learning to write using other writing systems like Latin, Hiragana, Katakana, Cyrillic, Georgian, Armenian, Arabic and other writing systems

### Practice, the main feature
Practice mode is the main feature of the app, it's a flashcard based system for learning characters. When you add a character to your dictionary it will be in the learning list,
then when you start practicing it will first be introduced fully a couple of times, then as you get better at drawing it, it components will be removed until you can recall how to write the character in its entirety

This is also useful for people new to languages with a script that's unknown to the learner

### Introduction to the writing system
The introduction feature starts on first login in the app and is designed to primarily help beginners with learning the writing techniques in their specific script as well as how to read and tips for remembering characters

For CJK languages that would be learning how to write dynamically, learning about radicals and tips for remembering the characters.

All languages provided also get a brief phonetics guide to help with pronunciation of letters and words

Non-CJK languages also have guides for handwriting

### Discover
While this is not a full language learning platform and definitely not a dictionary, discover mode helps you wind jnteresting characters or words which you can later add to your flashcards

### Story of the development of the app
The person who started the project, [Stanislav Vasilev(Madman10K)](https://madman10k.online) is a polyglot and at the time in 2023 he was primarily learning Chinese and German while also learning some Katakana in his spare time. At the time he knew or was learning 4 languages total:
1. Bulgarian 🇧🇬 - His mother tongue which is written in Cyrillic
1. English 🇬🇧 - His second language which is written in modified Latin
1. German 🇩🇪 - His third language which is written in modified Latin
1. Mandarin Chinese 🇨🇳 - His fourth language which is written in Chinese characters 汉字

While trying to learn Chinese a problem kept occurring, most apps out there didn't test for handwriting ability. There were many that used handwritten input but none actually trained for writing of characters.
Because of this he decided to start Youyin, a platform for training to write chinese characters.

The name comes from a bad joke about the video game amongus where the characters 卣 and 囙 look like ther characters in the game. Additionally the 2 words below are pronounced the same way with different tones
