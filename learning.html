			<h1>Tips for learning Chinese characters:</h1>
			<p>
				Let's begin with form: All chinese characters have a specific stroke order that needs to be strictly followed, currently we only use the PRC stroke order with the exception of
				Chinese characters created in Japan or Korea. Here is the stroke order for the character 想:
			</p>
			<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100px" height="100px" id="character-target-div-n" class="centered character-prop">
				<line x1="0" y1="0" x2="100%" y2="100%" stroke="#DDD" />
				<line x1="100%" y1="0" x2="0" y2="100%" stroke="#DDD" />
				<line x1="50%" y1="0" x2="50%" y2="100%" stroke="#DDD" />
				<line x1="0" y1="50%" x2="100%" y2="50%" stroke="#DDD" />
			</svg>
			<br>
			<button id="animate-button" class="card-button-edit">Animate</button>
			<script>
				var writer = HanziWriter.create('character-target-div-n', '想', {
					width: 100,
					height: 100,
					padding: 5,
					showOutline: true,
					strokeAnimationSpeed: 1.25,
					delayBetweenStrokes: 50,
				});
				document.getElementById('animate-button').addEventListener('click', function() {
					writer.animateCharacter();
				});
			</script>
			<p>
				Additionally, you might have noticed that strokes are dynamic, that is they start slow and press hard, then transition to fast and light. That's because Chinese characters have traditionally
				been written on paper using a brush, allowing for more dynamic strokes than in other writing systems. Notice the change in speed here:
			<p>
			<br>
			<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100px" height="100px" id="character-target-div-n1" class="centered character-prop">
				<line x1="0" y1="0" x2="100%" y2="100%" stroke="#DDD" />
				<line x1="100%" y1="0" x2="0" y2="100%" stroke="#DDD" />
				<line x1="50%" y1="0" x2="50%" y2="100%" stroke="#DDD" />
				<line x1="0" y1="50%" x2="100%" y2="50%" stroke="#DDD" />
			</svg>
			<br>
			<button id="animate-button-1" class="card-button-edit">Animate</button>
			<script>
				var writer1 = HanziWriter.create('character-target-div-n1', '想', {
					width: 100,
					height: 100,
					padding: 5,
					showOutline: true,
					strokeAnimationSpeed: 1,
					delayBetweenStrokes: 400,
				});
				document.getElementById('animate-button-1').addEventListener('click', function() {
					writer1.animateCharacter();
				});
			</script>
			<p>
				Generally you should apply the same principle when writing with a pen or pencil on paper. To get the hang of it, start practicing the initial strokes by starting slow and pressing hard, then
				finishing the stroke fast with light pressure. When learning characters, it's also recommended that you use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_(typefaces)">Ming/Song</a>
				or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_script">Regular Script</a> font, due to them having clear indicators for stroke directions. On Youyin, we use the Regular Script.

				Now to remembering characters: There are a couple of methods depending on the characters depending on their type. Pictograms are characters like 木, 日, 山 and 月. These characters represent
				a specific idea graphically. Characters similar to pictograms are the simple ideograms like 上, 下, 凸, 凹 which represent up, down, convex and concave respectivelly. Then there are
				compound ideographs like 明(sun next to moon = bright), 休(man next to tree = relaxed), 好(woman next to child = good). Finally there are phono-semantic compounds like 湖 and 河,
				both have the water radical 氵on their left side that determines their meaning, since the characters mean river and lake respectively. Their pronunciation is hé and hú respectively,
				where the pronunciation is determined by the main part of the character that being 胡(hú) and 可(kě).
